# dynamic-array-implementation-practice
A C++ implementation of a dynamic array class, mimicking the functionality of std::vector.

Key Feature:
- Dynamic memory allocation and management
- Template-based design for generic data types
- Efficient capacity and size management
- Iterator implementation for seamless integration with STL algorithms
- Exception handling for out-of-range access

Learning Objectives:
- Mastering dynamic memory allocation techniques
- Understanding STL container concepts
- Implementing efficient data structures from scratch

This project serves as an educational exercise to deepen understanding of C++ fundamentals, memory management, and template metaprogramming.
It's particularly useful for those looking to implement custom containers or understand the inner workings of sd::vector.

Future Improvements:
- performance optimization for large datasets
- Adding more advanced features like move semantics and emplace operations
- Extensive unit testing suite

Feel free to fork and improve this implementation.
